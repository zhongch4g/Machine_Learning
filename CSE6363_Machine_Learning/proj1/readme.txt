There are three python files, all of them need python3 and numpy module, first one and third one need matplotlib module.

Task one is named project1_1.py, it is a linear regression code. Just in terminal enter "python3 project1_1.py" to run this code, in run() function, we can set different order, here I test [1, 2, 3, 4, 7].


Task two is named project1_2.py, it is a logistic regression code. Just in terminal enter "python3 project1_2.py" to run this code. I have implement SGD and BGD to optimize model. We can change it in run() function.

Task three is named project1_3.py, it is a linear discriminative analysis code, Just in terminal enter "python3 project1_2.py" to run this code.
